        <h3 class="terence">Terence "Draco" Borjal studies BS Applied Technology at Brigham Young University Idaho. 
            He took the courses WDD130 and CSE111 and both are related to computer science. He has been very enthusiastic when it comes to data analytics and software.
            His strand during his Senior High School days was a Technical Vocational Track that specializes in Computer Programming. He's been very curious on how coding works on computers so he has decided to take that path towards higher education.
            One of his top goals in life is to become a CEO of his own company someday. 
        <br>
        <h3 class="terence">
            He became very inspired by Calvin Coolidge quote about persistence. President Coolidge said "Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. The slogan 'Press On!' has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race."    
        </h3>
        <h3 class="terence">
            Terence believes when you have figured out that you can teach yourself all things in this world, then you belong to that 1% that is extremely hard to find.

            When you don't need people or references to motivate yourself, then those that oppress will see you as a threat.
