        There will be a lot if that pertains to the scope of smartphones. They may ask like "What is the best high quality camera for a phone?", "What's faster for gaming, an iPhone or Huawei?" or "What's the best tool to measure my workout?" etc. - Product information that the user knows so they can browse and review devices. All the information that they need to know regarding that product. - Most of the sites in the net are not user friendly when it comes to design and interface. Most of the sites online don't compare devices with different products combined so what I will develop will educate people in the type of device they prefer and
        The site that I will be creating has a much simpler design in terms of viewing. People can easily view and get the information they need fast. It does not have to be sophisticated but rather its going to be informative with a design that is pleasing to the eyes. It is not usual to have website that contains details of product brands in one. There may be sites that already has that but as a starting foundation of this site, it can still be updated and developed more. In todays age, most people need a way for them to learn easier and faster. That’s why Google is very famous. When there’s a place where consumers are looking for a the best product but are still unsure of details and specs. The website that I have is a great place for everyone to learn and compare which one is the best that they see. It’s very simple at first but later on it will be updated into a much better environment where everybody will have the freedom to express their thoughts about the products that we have today.
